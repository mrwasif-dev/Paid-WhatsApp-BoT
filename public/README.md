# WASI-MD Web Dashboard 🌐

This folder holds the frontend pages for your bot. I wanted to make the bot easy to control even if you're not a coder, so I built this web interface.

### What can it do? 🚀
When you run the bot and visit the server URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`), you'll see a clean webpage. From there, you can:
- **Connect your account:** Scan the QR code or use the Pairing Code method directly from your browser.
- **Change Settings:** Update the bot name, prefix, owner number, or even the menu image without touching a single line of code.
- **Monitor Status:** See if your database is connected and how many active sessions are running.

### Folder Contents 📄
- **`index.html`:** The main (and only) page. It's built with modern CSS and vanilla JavaScript to be super fast and responsive on both mobile and PC.

### Quick Tip 💡
If you're hosting this on Heroku or a VPS, this is the page your friends or clients will see. I've designed it to look premium and "pro," so feel free to show it off!
