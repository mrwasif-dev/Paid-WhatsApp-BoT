# WASI-MD Assets 📂

This folder is for all the "extra" files the bot needs that aren't code. Think of it as the bot's toolbox for media, templates, and styling resources.

### What's inside?
- **`menu/`**: The collection of images used for the main menu background.

As the bot grows, you might see other folders here for stickers, audio clips, or custom themes. Storing things here keeps the root folder clean and easy to navigate.
