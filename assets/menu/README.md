# Menu Backgrounds 🎨

These are the images (and potentially videos) that the bot uses when it sends the `.menu` command. I've curated a few "aesthetic" looking ones to give the bot a premium feel.

### How does the bot pick an image? 🎲
The bot's menu system is quite smart. If you have `MENU_IMAGE_ASSET` enabled in your `.env` or config:
1. It looks into this folder.
2. It randomly picks one of the images here.
3. It sends it along with the command list.

### Want to add your own? 📸
It's super easy! Just drop your favorite `.jpg` or `.png` files into this folder. I recommend using the same "Aesthetic" or "Minimalist" style so the bot stays looking Sharp and Pro.
